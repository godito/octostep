# octostep
A library for Arduino to control up to 24 StepSticks with MCP23017s through I2C on a MEGA board.
Aditionally, you can switch up to 24 peripherals through another set of MCP23017s and ULN2803s.
I also provide the board layouts in eagle.
I will add a better documentation asap. I case you want a board, I have a couple of them to spare.
